# User Story
This app gives users a fast and easy way to track their money and allow them to access that information anytime. Having offline functionality is paramount to my applications success. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

# Objective
The Budget Tracker uses Mongo database with a Mongoose schema to handle routes with Express.

# Technologies
* Javascript
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
